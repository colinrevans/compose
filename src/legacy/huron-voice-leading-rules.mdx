# David Huron's Voice Leading Preference Rules

## Voice Leading, a Scientific Approach (Huron, 2016)

*Note: David Huron, recently retired, is one of the world's leading music psychologists. His first major book, *Sweet Anticipation*, draws from decades worth of empirical research in order to investigate the emotions we feel when listening to music. His most recent work, *Voice Leading, a Scientific Approach*, uses findings from psychoacoustics to help account for what drives the rules of western counterpoint. Its appendix includes a list of preference rules, explained throughout. The rules are as follows. Interested readers should get the book! It happens to be a favorite. Some rules are familiar (eg, the perfect parallels rule), while others are rather novel (eg, asynchronous onsets rule). For those interested, Wolfgang Rubsam's [lautenwerk recording of Bach's well-tempered clavier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41tx1TQEUbg) uses asynchronous onsets plentifully.*

If a musician chooses to create music in which two or more concurrent parts or voices are intended to be heard as perceptually distinct, then the following preferences should be observed:

1. **Toneness rule.** Prefer harmonic complex tones rather than inharmonic or aperiodic sounds.
2. **Compass rule.** Prefer the pitch region between about E2 [82Hz] and G5 [784Hz], centered near D4 [294Hz].
3. **Sustained sound rule.** Prefer continuous or sustained tones in close succession, with few long gaps or silences.
4. **Spacing rule.** Prefer wider spacing between the lower tones in a sonority.
5. **Tessitura rule.** Increasingly prefer wider spacing as the sonority becomes lower in overall pitch.
6. **Unisons rule.** Resist shared pitches between voices.
7. **Octaves rule.** Resist the interval of an octave between two voices.
8. **Compound fifths rule.** Resist the interval of a perfect fifth (and its compound octave equivalents) between two voices.
9. **Harmonic fusion rule.** Resist unisons more than octaves, octaves more than perfect twelfths, perfect twelfths more than perfect fifths, and perfect fifths more than other intervals.
10. **Common tone rule.** If successive sonorities share a common pitch class, prefer to retain this as a single pitch within one voice.
11. **Conjunct motion rule.** If a voice cannot retain the same pitch from one sonority to the next, the preferred pitch motion is by step. Resist large melodic intervals.
12. **Leap lengthening rule.** When a large leap is unavoidable, long durations are preferred for either one or both of the tones forming the leap.
13. **Proximity rule.** Prefer writing parts that move to the nearest chordal tone in the next sonority.
14. **Crossing rule.** Resist the crossing of parts with respect to pitch.
15. **Overlap rule.** Resist "overlapped" parts in which a pitch in an ostensibly lower voice is higher than the subsequent pitch in an ostensibly higher voice.
16. **Leap away rule.** When large melodic intervals are used, prefer to assign it to the highest of lowest voice, and prefer to leap away from the other voices.
17. **Semblant motion rule.** Prefer nonsemblant over semblant motion between concurrent parts; that is, resist similar or parallel motions.
18. **Parallel motion rule.** If semblant motion is necessary, prefer similar motion over parallel motion.
19. **Oblique preparation rule.** When approaching unisons, octaves, fifteenths, twelfths, or fifths, it is preferable to retain the same pitch in one of the voices (i.e., approach by oblique motion).
20. **Conjunct preparation rule.** If it is not possible to approach unisons, octaves, fifteenths, twelfths, or fifths by retaining the same pitch (oblique motion), then step motion is the next preferred approach.
21. **Nonsemblant preparation rule.** Resist similar pitch motion in which the voices employ unisons, octaves, or perfect twelfths/fifths (e.g., when both parts ascend beginning an octave apart, and end a fifth apart).
22. **Perfect parallels rule.** Resist parallel unisons, octaves, twelfths, and fifths.
23. **Direct intervals rule.** When approaching unisons, octaves, twelfths, fifths, or fifteenths by similar motion, step motion is preferred preceding the upper pitch forming the interval.
24. **Asynchronous onsets rule.** Prefer asynchronous onsets for concurrent voices.
25. **Asynchronous preparation rule.** When approaching unisons, octaves, twelfths, or fifths, prefer asynchronous note onsets.
26. **Embellishments rule.** It is preferable to interpose embellishments (like passing tones) between successive sonorities.
27. **Embellishment preference rule.** Prefer embellishments using step motion (like passing tones, neighbor tones, suspensions and retardations) or no motion (pedal tones, repititions and anticipations). Use embellishments involving leaps (like scape tones, appoggiaturas, and arpeggiations) less often.
28. **Doubled pitch-class rule.** Prefer adding embellishments to voices that double the pitch class of another concurrent voice.
29. **Embellished refresh rule.** Prefer to add embellishments to voices that have not been embellished recently.
30. **Follow tendencies rule.** Prefer to resolve tendency tones in the expected (i.e. most common) manner.

Some common (though fallible) simplifications of the above *tendencies rule* include the following four more concrete situations:

31. **Chromatic resolution rule.** When a chromatically altered pitch is introduced, prefer the expected resolution.
32. **Chromatic backtracking rule.** When a chromatically altered pitch is introducted, don't backtrack by returning to the unaltered pitch.
33. **False relation rule.** Prefer to avoid two successive sonorities where a chromatically altered pitch appears in one voice but the unaltered pitch appears in the preceding or following sonority in another voice.
34. **Uncommon intervals rule.** Prefer to avoid an infrequently used melodic interval unless you plan to use lots of them (that is, unless you plan to take advantage of *dynamic-adaptive* expectations).
35. **Augmented intervals rule.** Prefer to avoid augmented melodic intervals unless you plan to use lots of them (i.e., take advantage of dynamic-adaptive expectations).
36. **Repetitive patterns rule.** Prefer to repeat distinctive melodic patterns, such as themes, motives, figures, subjects, or other sequences.
37. **Doubling rule.** Prefer to avoid doubling tendency tones, such as chromatic notes, the leading tone, or other tones that in context would evoke strong expectations.
