## Discourse on Music from the Hibeh Papyri<None> | </None>

All the way back in the 4th century BC we have a document skeptical of music's ability to instill attributes of character. The writer is unknown to us, but the target appears to be Damon, a Greek thinker from the 5th century BC, and those who took after him.<Cite entry='damon' from={citations} /> [Robert Wallace](https://www.classics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/robert-wallace.html), a scholar from Northwestern University, is the foremost authority on him and his influence. His book *[Reconstructing Damon: Music, Wisdom Teaching, and Politics in Perkles' Athens](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reconstructing-damon-9780199685738?cc=us&lang=en&#)* came out in 2015, and is all but unavailable unless you've got access to a university library. The Hibeh Papyri are up on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/hibehpapyri01egypuoft/page/44), though, including introductions of both the discourse and other portions of the papyri. The fragment of the discourse on music, possibly by Hippias, is as follows (original greek linked):


<blockquote>
"It has often been an occasion of suprise to me, men of Hellas, that certain persons, who make displays foreign to their own arts, should pass unobserved. They claim to be musical, and select and compare different tunes, bestowing indiscriminate blame upon some and praise upon others. They assert that they ought not to be regarded as harpers and singers, for these subjects, they say, they concede to others, while their own special province is the theoretical part. They appear, however, to take no small interest in what they concede to others, and to speak at random in what they say are their own strong subjects. They assert that some tunes make us temperate, others wise, others just, others brave, others cowardly, being unaware that enharmonic melody would no more make its votaries brave than chromatic will make them cowards. Who is there who does not know that the Aetolians and Dolopes, and all the folk round Thermopylae use a diatonic system of music, and yet are braver than the tragedians who are regularly accustomed to use the enharmonic scale? Therefore enharmonic melody makes men brave no more than chromatic makes them cowardly. To such lengths of confidence do they go that they waste all their life over strings, harping far worse than the harpers, singing worse than the singers, making comparisons worse than the common rhetorician,--doing everything worse than any one else. With regard to the so-called harmonics, in which, so they say, they have a certain state of mind, they can give this no articulate expression; but go into ecstasies, and keeping time to the rhythm strike the board beneath them in accompaniment to the sounds of the harp. They are not even ashamed to declare that some tunes will have properties of laurel, and others of ivy, and also to ask whether..."</blockquote>

The Hibeh archaeological site was [looted](http://www.hibeh.org/looting/) during the [Egyptian revolution of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_revolution_of_2011), and remains unprotected. In recent years researchers have had to rebury ancient body parts and the like. You can read more about the archaeological site at the [Hibeh Project](http://www.hibeh.org/), including further information about the papyri.

Unsurprisingly, Aristotle and Plato both have writing about music and ethics too. It's rather heavily covered elsewhere.

## Talks on Music, Yue Yan

The talks on music is one of a few early sources on music. Google books has an excerpt of a chapter by So Jeong Park detailing the philosophical background, often retrospectively homogenized: [Sound, Tone, and Music in Early China: The Philosophical Foundation of Chinese Sound Culture](https://books.google.com/books?id=itgxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&lpg=PA273&dq=talks+on+music+yue+yan&source=bl&ots=2kML_HqqCw&sig=ACfU3U1kK4HrJPdJEyKT1e780Y9Nuc6G_Q&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6_obajJDlAhXKm-AKHXXiBrkQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=talks%20on%20music%20yue%20yan&f=false)
