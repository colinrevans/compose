# Ravel's Piano Works

<CitationManager />

Many analyses of Ravel's piano works already exist: notably Messaien and Loriod's *Analyses of the Piano Works of Maurice Ravel*,<Cite entry='messaien' from={citations} />  Oleksii Ivanchenko's 2015 doctoral thesis, which is [open access](https://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2430&context=oa_dissertations),<Cite entry='ivanchenko' from={citations} /> and more. By virtue of their format, they're unable to communicate some aspects of the score. Most notably--a setback for any work of analysis before the internet--music theoretical concepts are unavailable except to trained readers of sheet music. Music is one field where the digital humanities has a lot to offer, as opposed to other disciplines where it reveals primarily circumstantial or empirically trivial information.<Cite entry='da' from={citations} /> Perhaps instead technology can stand in for a nonexistent piano. Reading music analysis without some kind of instrument at hand is comparable to being asked to view each color of a painting, in splendid detail, in the mind's eye--in doing so, we replace color with color wheel, sound with circle of fifths, lose our object of inquiry, and resort all too often to taste-making. Books are poorly suited. Vasari's *Lives* is a poor argument for viewing its discussed works, whatever the mystique of greatness thereby attached. Or: the most compelling argument against an art library argues its dependence. I daresay the point of analysis, in music theory's case, never was to help discern; it was rather to help replicate and modify. When analysis aspires to something else, it is often [nothing innocent](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Found-c4rev.pdf).<Cite entry='weininger' from={citations} />
*How* a piece of music does what it does is psychology, then psychoacoustics, neuroscience, and therefore, eventually, physics. How to skip over the details and produce something rather tantalizing is music theory. The rest is musicology. The analysis of Ravel that follows is mostly practical. Brutally: how does one appopriate him and move on?
