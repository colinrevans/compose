<Answers section="chapter 1" last>

<qstn>
1. What are the two main functions of an operating system?

Operating systems abstract away the machine level specifics of how the system works, providing programmers with easier-to-reason-about encapsulations of the functionality of a system. This requires that the operating system manage hardware resources like, eg, memory, providing "virtual memory" that appears contiguous to user-level programs.

</qstn>

<qstn>
2. In Section 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of applications for each of these systems (one per operating systems type).

*Mainframe OS.* Mainframe operating systems allow massive amounts of I/O, and are therefore suited for data centers that need to process many requests at once. Netlify, the host of this site, would be the kind of service that would need something like a mainframe operating system; everybody's site needs to be both hosted and managed according to the paygrade of the customer. As the section writes, however, "many mainframe operating systems are gradually being replaced by UNIX variants such as Linux": the fact that a business needs to process many requests at once doesn't necessarily imply it uses a mainframe operating system.

*Server OS.* As expected, they run on servers; a PHP backend to, say, a commerce web app might be on a machine with a server operating system.

*Multiprocessor OS.* Multiprocessor OS's create a single system out of multiple CPUs, sometimes including multiple machines. Because of this they need to take special care to keep concurrent processes from interfering with one another. Problems from many domains can leverage the processing power of a multiprocessor OS: google's foray into cloud gaming, where the majority of the graphics rendering happens on a server, not the client, is one application that could leverage a multiprocessor OS effectively. That said, personal computers can make use of multiple cores as well, for example in order to keep GUI functionality quick while programs do involved processing.

*Handheld computer operating system.* Smartphone apps and launchers.

*Embedded operating systems.* Internet of things devices, like light switches that are controllable from a distance.

*Sensor-node operating systems.* Environment monitoring for light or some other variable that's nontrivial to measure.

*Real time operating systems.* Any industrial setting where processes must happen at a certain time; eg, for mechanized assembly arms in factories. Hard real-time systems don't allow for any slack, whereas soft real-time systems do.

*Smart card operating systems.* Only simple tasks, like electronic payments.

<qstn>
3. What is the difference between timesharing and multiprogramming systems?

Multiprogramming allows the CPU to run another job if one job becomes blocking. Timesharing allows multiple programmers to access one system through their own online terminal: the CPU moves between jobs of active users.

</qstn>

<qstn>
4. To use cache memory, main memory is divided into cache lines, typically 32 or 64 bytes long. An entire cache line is cached at once. What is the advantage of caching an entire line instead of a single byte or word at a time?

Data stored in adjacent or nearby parts of memory is often necessary to complete a procedure. We usually want to, eg, cache the adjacent addresses of a C array rather than just one element.

</qstn>

<qstn>
5. On early computers, every byte of data read or written was handled by the CPU (i.e., there was no DMA). What implications does this have for multiprogramming?

Without a DMA, multiprogramming systems have to continually see through I/O operations like file reading. This means they can't switch to other jobs as easily or efficiently.

</qstn>

<qstn>
6. Instructions related to accessing I/O devices are typically priveleged instructions, that is, they can be executed in kernel mode but not user mode. Give a reason why these instructions are priveleged.

If they were not priveleged, user mode applications could demand that the most recent I/O input always go to it, so that other processes would never hear back from a blocking I/O call.

</qstn>

<qstn>
7. The family-of-computers idea was introduced in the 1960s with the IBM System/360 mainframes. Is this idea now dead as a doornail or oes it live on?

</qstn>

<qstn>
8. One reason GUIs were initially slow to be adopted was the cost of the hardware needed to support them. How much video RAM is needed to support a 25-line X 80-row character monochrome text screen? How much for a 1200x900-pixel 24-bit color bit-map? What was the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices ($5/KB)? How much is it now?

</qstn>

<qstn>
9. There are several design goals in building an operating system, for example, resource utilization, timeliness, robustness, and so on. Give an example of two design goals that may contradict one another.

a. <m>(p \land q) \implies p</m> is only false when the left hand side is true, the right false. So let's say p is false. then <m>p \land q</m> must be true, but it can't be, cause p is false.

b. <m>p \implies (p \lor q)</m> is only false when the left hand side is true, the right false. So p must be true, but then (p \lor q) can never be false.

c. p must be false, but then p \implies q is true no matter what. no luck.

d. right hand side must be false, so p \implies q must be false, so p is true and q is false. but then p \land q is true, making the whole thing true.

e. p must be false. but p \implies q must also be false, which is impossible.

so <m>\neg p</m> must be false, so <m>p</m>is true.<br />
both terms in the and of the left side must be true.<br />

<p><m>\neg (p \iff q)</m> means p and q are not logically equivalent. <m>p \iff \neg q</m> says the same thing: p is logically equivalent to q's inverse, or, p and q are not logically equivalent.</p>

<p><m>\neg p \iff q</m> means q is logically equivalent to p's inverse. <m>p \iff \neg q</m> means p is logically equivalent to q's inverse. Since there are only two options for both p and q, these must be the same.</p>

the right hand side is only false when r is false and p \lor q is true. the left hand side is only false when r is false and either p or q is true.

the right hand side is only false when r is false and p \land q is true, or p is true and q is true. The left hand is false whenever r is false and both p and q are true.
</qstn>

<qstn>
27. 

p \iff q is to say p and q are logically equivalent. The only time p \implies q is false is when p is true and q is false. The only time q \implies p is false is when q is true and p is false. Both cover the two cases in which p is not q. So both expressions mean the same thing.

29. 

the whole thing can only be false if <m>p \implies r</m> can be false  while <m>(p \implies q) \land (q \implies r)</m> is true. is <m>p \implies </m> is false, then p is true and r is false. since p \implies q must be true, q must also be true. since q is true, r must also be true. But we know that r must be false. Thus, it's a tautology.
</qstn>

<qstn>
31. 

we can show that they are not logically equivalent if, for one set of values of p, q, and r, the expressions' values are different. Let's say p is false, q is true, and r is false. Then <m>(p \implies q) \implies r</m> becomes <m>t \implies r</m>, which is true. But <m>p \implies (q \implies r)</m> becomes <m>p \implies f</m>, which is false. Thus, both expressions are not logically equivalent.
</qstn>

<qstn>
33. we can show that they are not logically equivalent if, for one set of values of p, q, r, and s, the expressions' values are different. Let's say p is false, q is true, r is false, and s is false. Then the first expression becomes t implies t, which is true. The second expression becomes false \implies false (t) \implies t \implies false (f), which is false. Thus, both expressions are not logically equivalent.

g. <m>\exists y (\forall X L(x, y) \land \forall w(\forall z (L(w, z) \implies y = z)))</m>. <e>NOTE:</e> had to look this one up. the question calls for *exactly one* object of affection, and I was struggling to find a way to express it. Doing even numbered exercises for this one too.

h. <m>\exists x \exists z (L(Lynn, x) \land L(Lynn, y) \land x \neq z \land \forall w(L(Lynn, w) \implies w = x \lor w = z))</m>

i. <m>\forall x (L(x, x))</m>

j. <m>\exists x (L(x, x) \land \forall w (L(x, w) \implies w = x))</m>. <e>NOTE:</e> Solution has a different answer, but I'm thinking they might be equivalent. Their solution is <m>\exists x \forall y (L(x, y) \iff x = y)</m>. So, let's make a truth table with a group of, say, 4 people: a, b, c, d, and say everyone only loves themselves. Does it come out all true? If both equations are right, they are logically equivalent, and will both come out equivalent for every permutation of its inputs.

<p><m>x</m> | <m>w</m> | <m>L(x, x)</m> | <m>L(x, w)</m> | <m>w = x</m> | <m>L(x, w) \implies w = x</m> | <m>L(x, x) \land ...</m><br />
a | a | true    | true    | true  | true                   | true<br />
a | b | true    | false    | false | true                  | true<br />
a | c | true    | false    | false | true                  | true<br />
a | d | true    | false    | false | true                  | true<br />
we can stop here, because we know that if we switch x to something other than a we'll get the same table with positions rotated around.</p>

<p><m>x</m> | <m>y</m> | <m>L(x, y)</m> | <m>x = y</m> | <m>L(x, y) \iff x = y</m><br />
a | a | true    | true  | true<br />
a | b | false    | false | true<br />
a | c | false    | false | true<br />
a | d | false    | false | true<br /></p>

So they are equivalent. How could I have found that out without making a truth table?
